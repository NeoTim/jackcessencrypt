    <title>Upgrading from Jackcess Encrypt 1.x to 2.x</title>
  </properties>

    <section name="Why the new version?">
      <p>
        The Jackcess project has changed its public API to version 2.x as part
        of a long-overdue overhaul.  These changes are superficial, but are not
        backwards compatible with Jackcess 1.x (<a href="http://jackcess.sourceforge.net/jackcess-2.html">full details
        here</a>).  Jackcess Encrypt has similarly changed its version number in
        order to make it easy to match compatible versions:
        <ul>
          <li>Jackcess 2.x -&gt; Jackcess Encrypt 2.y</li>
          <li>Jackcess 1.x -&gt; Jackcess Encrypt 1.y</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section name="What does this mean for 1.x?">
      <p>
        Moving forward, all new feature development will be in Jackcess
        Encrypt 2.x.  The Jackcess Encrypt 1.x code has been branched at
        version 1.0.4 and some bugfixes may be backported to that branch on a
        case by case basis.  However, no new feature development will be done
        on the 1.x branch.
